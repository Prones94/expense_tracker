<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Expense Tracker][product-screenshot]](https://expense-tracker-with-speech.netlify.app/)

This is an easy to use budget tracker that handles both your income and expenses! Not only will this application remember the data you added yesterday, but there is also a talk-to-text feature, which allows you to create new reports without having to click multiple boxes, saving you time and wrist pain. Expenses and income are easily seen by the circle graph with different shades of red or green depending on the category.

Here's why I created this:
* I wanted to create an easy to use budget tracker that allowed for it to remember past expenses or income and be easily categorized
* I created this to be similar to a banking app's budget tracker, but easier to access
* Having the option to say and watch my computer pick up my voice and allow it make transactions is amazing.

Of course, this project is still brand new, and I will be adding more features in the near future, so please stay tuned for any new updates!
